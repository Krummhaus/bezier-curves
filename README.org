** Dired
I should definitly learn more about dired

*** Emacs dired basics controls
Dired has countless functionality. The best way to learn it is to try it out. Open a dired buffer and look at the commands listed in the menus.

    **[C-x d]** (or M-x dired)
    ask for a directory and puts you into a buffer with direct listing of that directory.

    **[C-x C-j]** (or M-x dired-jump)
    jump to a dired buffer corresponding to the current buffer (This require loading Dired Extra).
    In the minibuffer, while doing 'Find File':

    **[C-d]**
    jump to a dired buffer corresponding to the directory in the minibuffer.

    RET or f Open file or directory
    o   Open file in a separate window
    ^   Up directory
    +   Create a directory
    R   Rename / move
    C   Copy
    M   Change file/directory mode (unix file/directory permissions)
    d   Delete
    m   Mark
    u   Unmark / undelete
    x   'Expunge' -- i.e. actually delete files/directories marked for deletion
